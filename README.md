## Raytracer: A simple raytracer

#### Authors:
    * Chance Nelson (cbn35@nau.edu)

#### Building
Run `make` for building
Run `make clean` to clean build

#### Usage
* `./raytrace width height config.csv image`

#### Known Issues
All code compiles just fine, and the csv file is completely parsed, and intersects are being recorded correctly, however images come out completely blank. This is due to a bug somewhere in the lighting code that I was unable to find in time.


**NOTE**: Config files accept a max of 255 entities
